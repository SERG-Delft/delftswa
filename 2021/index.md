## Assignment

Students will work in [teams](assignment.html#team-formation) of four.
Team work includes:

1. [Selecting an open source system](assignment.html#picking): The system needs to be sufficiently complex, under active development, and open to external contributions.
2. Writing four [essays](assignment.html#essays), covering
    1. the product [vision](assignment.html#vision), including required capabilities, roadmap, product context, and stakeholder analysis.
    2. [architectural decisions made](assignment.html#architecture), including system decomposition, tradeoff points, as well as architectural styles and patterns adopted.
    3. an assessment of [quality and (potential) technical debt](assignment.html#quality); and
    4. a [deeper analysis](assignment.html#deepening) based on the lectures or other relevant material specific to the system of choice;
3. [Contributing changes](assignment.html#contributions) to the open source system selected (via pull requests submitted on GitHub)
4. Preparing a final video summarizing the key results, and answering questions about it (online).
5. Reviewing work from other teams, to learn from them, and to give them feedback

The four essays can build upon each other, but should be independently readable.
We will collect all essays in an online book, that will emerge throughout the course.
You can watch our progress (for essays made public) at [desosa2020.netlify.com][desosa2020].

## Grades

Students will receive grades based on the following:

- `E`: Team performance for each of the four essays (1-10), composed form the average of the four essays E1..E4.
- `C`: Team performance for code contributions (1-10)
- `P`: Team performance for video presentation (1-10)
- `R`: Individual performance in peer reviews (-1, 0, 1) -- zero by default
- `A`: Individual performance in participation (-1, 0, 1) -- zero by default

The _team grade_ is the weighted average of the team activities:

    T = (3*E + C + P)/5

The _individual grade_ then is the team grade to which a bonus can be added (or subtracted) for exceptional (top/bottom X%) results.

	I = T + 0.5 * (R + A)
