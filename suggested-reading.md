There is a vast amount of material on software architecture available on the web.
Here we list some material that we found most useful.
This is a living list -- if there is a resource you are particularly enthusiastic about let us know (or file a [pull request](https://github.com/SERG-Delft/delftswa)).

### General Books

1. Cesare Pautasso. Software Architecture: Visual Lecture Notes. Leanpub, 2020. [leanpub.com][cesare].
  _Rich book based on years of teaching software architecture at the University of Lugano. Highly accessible, also because the book is almost literally a recording of lectures, including slides. Focus on quality attributes and how to realize them._

1. Amy Brown and Greg Wilson (editors). The Architecture of Open Source Applications. Volumes 1-2, 2012. [aosabook.org][aosabook].
  _Source of inspiration of this course. Great set of articles describing architectures of selected open source applications, written by experts on these sytems_

1. Jim Coplien and Gertrud Bj√∏rnvig. [Lean Architecture][lsa]. Wiley, 2010.
  _A book targeting smaller teams, with a strong focus on delivering (customer) value_.

1. Nick Rozanski and Eoin Woods. [Software Systems Architecture: Working with Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives][views]. Addison-Wesley, 2012, 2nd edition.
  _A somewhat abstract book, yet based on years of experience of the authors in an enterprise setting. Perhaps more of a reference than a book to study cover to cover, but full of useful views, perspectives, and patterns._

1. Gregor Hohpe. [The Software Architect Elevator](https://architectelevator.com/book/). O'Reilly, 2020. _Argues that the successful architect should easily navigate between "engine room" (in the basement) and the boardroom (at the top of the sky scraper). Book based on years of experience from the trenches. Don't miss Hohpe's [50 min. techtalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq2VcRZmz78) summarizing the key points of this book. See also the summary on [Martin Fowler's bliki](https://martinfowler.com/articles/architect-elevator.html). Hohpe also has an "[architect's bookshelf](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/) with recommendations for almost 20 books._

1. Sam Newman. [Building Microservices](https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices_2nd_edition/), 2nd edition. O'Reilly, 2021. _Everything you always wanted to know about micro-services, including a people's perspective_.

### The Role of the Architect

1. Martin Fowler. Who needs an architect? IEEE Software, 2003 ([pdf](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf)). _Reflections on what architecture is and what an architect does in just 2.5 page._
