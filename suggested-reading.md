There is a vast amount of material on software architecture available on the web.
Here we list some material that we found most useful.

1. Cesare Pautasso. Software Architecture: Visual Lecture Notes. Leanpub, 2020. [leanpub.com][cesare].
  _Rich book based on years of teaching software architecture at the University of Lugano. Highly accessible, also because the book is almost literally a recording of lectures, including slides. Focus on quality attributes and how to realize them._

1. Amy Brown and Greg Wilson (editors). The Architecture of Open Source Applications. Volumes 1-2, 2012. [aosabook.org][aosabook].
  _Source of inspiration of this course. Great set of articles describing architectures of selected open source applications, written by experts on these sytems_

1. Jim Coplien and Gertrud Bj√∏rnvig. [Lean Architecture][lsa]. Wiley, 2010.
  _A book targeting smaller teams, with a strong focus on delivering (customer) value_.

1. Nick Rozanski and Eoin Woods. [Software Systems Architecture: Working with Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives][views]. Addison-Wesley, 2012, 2nd edition.
  _A somewhat abstract book based on extensive experience of the authors in an enterprise setting. Useful views, perpsectives, and patterns. More of a reference than a book to study cover to cover._
